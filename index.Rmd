### Senior Scientist, Proteomics, LC-MS/MS, and Data Science

I am a PhD biochemist with 10 years of experience in proteomics, including
quantitative shotgun and targeted approaches. I am a strong advocate for reproducible
research and data integrity. My recent professional development has focused on best statistical practices for data
analysis and interpretation, as well as clear and transparent communication of results.

I am particularly interested in opportunities with dynamic and energetic teams which leverage data science
(statistical analysis and modeling) to provide deeper insights that address biological questions about mechanism of action and health.
